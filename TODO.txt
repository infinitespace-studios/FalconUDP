TODO
----
- include packet size and version no. in join request so incompatiable falcon peers cannot join eachother
- consider determining addresses to broadcast to at time of discovery not at startup (could have changed, though it does take time to calc this)
- pool RemotePeers and they should refernce pools on FalconPeer rather than having their own
- Default MaxDatagramSize to 1400 bytes

One day
-------
- IPv6 and other underlying protocols support
- WinRT port
- Optimistic Reliable congestion controlled delivery
