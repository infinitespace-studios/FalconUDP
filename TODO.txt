TODO
----
- include packet size and version no. in join request
- replace SocketAsyncEventArgs usage with BufferSegmant from BufferPool and Packet's can inherit from BufferSegmant
- consider determining addresses to broadcast to at time of discovery not at startup (could have changed, though it does take a little time)
- pool RemotePeers and they should get their buffers from common pool

One day
-------
- IPv6 and other underlying protocols support
- WinRT port
